Title: Chunking Data in Pandas DataFrame and Calculating Summation

Description:
This Python script demonstrates how to chunk data in a Pandas DataFrame based on a specific column and calculate the summation of values within each chunk. The code iterates over the DataFrame, dividing it into chunks of a specified size and calculating the summation of a particular column within each chunk. If no rows meet the condition for a chunk, a summation of 0 is assigned to that chunk.

Usage:

Modify the DataFrame or provide your own DataFrame named 'df' containing the data.
Define the starting value and chunk size according to your data.
Run the script to generate the desired output, which includes the starting and ending values for each chunk along with the summation of values within each chunk.
Dependencies:

Python 3.x
pandas library
Example:

# Run the script with your DataFrame and parameters
python chunk_and_sum.py
